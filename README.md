# Brief information
Personal Projects [WIP] build with React and I am using [CommerceJS - @Chec](https://github.com/chec/commerce.js) as the back end to store all information for my products. Future implementation would be [StripeJS](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js) for faking the payment method.

As of now i completed the registration of my products and informations (prices, images, description, etc) via CommerceJS and already integrated into my React Component.
Noted that there are still a lot of bug fixes to be done and still have works to do before I could consider it is 100% working.
